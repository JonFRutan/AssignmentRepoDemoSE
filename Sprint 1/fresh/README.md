Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation
https://fresh.deno.dev/
https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started

Then start the project:
'deno task start'
The frontend can be updated by saving the file then refreshing the page.

Deno is a newer platform for frontend development, and I believe it will be both easier for us to use/manage and more effective.
'Fresh'
